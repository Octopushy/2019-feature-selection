The research addresses the need for improved monitoring of areas included in the European Natura 2000 network. Thirty-eight vegetation indices (VI) are assessed for sensitivity to topographic variations. A separability analysis is performed for the resulting set of ten VI whereby two VI (PSSRc2, SR 800/550) are found most suitable for threshold-based OBIA classification. With a correlation analysis (SRCC) between VI and the training samples we identify Datt4 as suitable to represent the magnitude of forest disturbance. The provided information layers illustrate two combined phenomena that were derived by (1) an OBIA delineation and (2) continuous representation of the magnitude of forest disturbance. The satisfactory accuracy assessment results confirm that the approach is useful for operational tasks in the long-term monitoring of Norway spruce dominated forests in mountainous areas, with regard to forest disturbance.},

  abstract = {Data-trained predictive models see widespread use, but for the most part they are used as black boxes which output a prediction or score. It is therefore hard to acquire a deeper understanding of model behavior and in particular how different features influence the model prediction. This is important when interpreting the behavior of complex models or asserting that certain problematic attributes (such as race or gender) are not unduly influencing decisions. In this paper, we present a technique for auditing black-box models, which lets us study the extent to which existing models take advantage of particular features in the data set, without knowing how the models work. Our work focuses on the problem of indirect influence: how some features might indirectly influence outcomes via other, related features. As a result, we can find attribute influences even in cases where, upon further direct examination of the model, the attribute is not referred to by the model at all. Our approach does not require the black-box model to be retrained. This is important if, for example, the model is only accessible via an API, and contrasts our work with other methods that investigate feature influence such as feature selection. We present experimental evidence for the effectiveness of our procedure using a variety of publicly available data sets and models. We also validate our procedure using techniques from interpretable learning and feature selection, as well as against other black-box auditing procedures. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we use it to audit a black-box recidivism prediction algorithm.},

  abstract = {When fitting black box supervised learning models (e.g., complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbors, local kernel-weighted methods, etc.), visualizing the main effects of the individual predictor variables and their low-order interaction effects is often important, and partial dependence (PD) plots are the most popular approach for accomplishing this. However, PD plots involve a serious pitfall if the predictor variables are far from independent, which is quite common with large observational data sets. Namely, PD plots require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data, which can render the PD plots unreliable. Although marginal plots (M plots) do not require such extrapolation, they produce substantially biased and misleading results when the predictors are dependent, analogous to the omitted variable bias in regression. We present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects (ALE) plots, which inherits the desirable characteristics of PD and M plots, without inheriting their preceding shortcomings. Like M plots, ALE plots do not require extrapolation; and like PD plots, they are not biased by the omitted variable phenomenon. Moreover, ALE plots are far less computationally expensive than PD plots.},

This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

  abstract = {Finding a good predictive model for a high-dimensional data set can be challenging. For genetic data, it is not only important to find a model with high predictive accuracy, but it is also important that this model uses only few features and that the selection of these features is stable. This is because, in bioinformatics, the models are used not only for prediction but also for drawing biological conclusions which makes the interpretability and reliability of the model crucial. We suggest using three target criteria when fitting a predictive model to a high-dimensional data set: the classification accuracy, the stability of the feature selection, and the number of chosen features. As it is unclear which measure is best for evaluating the stability, we first compare a variety of stability measures. We conclude that the Pearson correlation has the best theoretical and empirical properties. Also, we find that for the stability assessment behaviour it is most important that a measure contains a correction for chance or large numbers of chosen features. Then, we analyse Pareto fronts and conclude that it is possible to find models with a stable selection of few features without losing much predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {While ridges and furrows on the surface of rock glaciers are probably the most characteristic morphological features of this expression of creeping mountain permafrost, this is the first study that examines the utility of texture filters in detecting rock glacier flow structures. Texture features were derived from a Gabor filterbank applied to two panchromatic IKONOS orthoimages from the Chilean Andes, and terrain attributes were obtained in order to narrow down the area of interest and as additional predictor variables. Four classification methods of different complexity (generalized linear model, GLM; generalized additive model, GAM; support vector machine, SVM; Bundling) were applied to three sets of predictor variables (texture attributes, terrain attributes, and the combination of both), and predictive performances were estimated using two spatial cross-validation strategies in terms of the median area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve (AUROC). Overall, classifiers utilizing texture attributes alone or, usually even better, in combination with terrain attributes outperformed terrain attributes alone, and Bundling (in most cases followed by SVM) showed the overall best performance as a classification method. Cross-validated median AUROC values were mostly between 0.70 and 0.80, or ``fair,'' in this focused pilot study, but much better results are to be expected at the landscape scale. Permutation-based spatial variable importance measures indicate that Gabor features corresponding to texture wavelengths between 10 and 30m are the most important predictors, which is consistent with typical ridge spacing on rock glaciers. Confounding occurred mostly in areas with linear erosion features and ridges or scarps in morainic and thermokarst terrain. We suggest that texture filters and the chosen methodological approach are relevant not only for rock glacier mapping but also for delineating debris-covered glaciers and characterizing glacier surfaces, as well as for other geomorphological and cryospheric applications.},

  abstract = {Mapping the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes is important for informing soil use and management decisions. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of DSM are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other DSM studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination. Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used. Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes.

  abstract = {A consistent and hierarchical classification of vegetation, such as the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (NVC) system, supports comprehensive conservation and management of natural ecosystems. At a detailed level, the NVC alliance is defined by diagnostic species and composition. Maps at this level of classification are often produced at local to regional scales (areas {$<$}25,000 km2) with costly manual to semi-automated interpretation of high resolution imagery. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of machine learning for automated, per-pixel (30 m) mapping of forest alliances with multi-seasonal hyperspectral imagery from a future satellite mission (HyspIRI), as simulated from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer Classic (AVIRIS-C) data. The study area was the San Francisco (S.F.) Bay Area, California, where we mapped forest alliances at regional and county scales. We implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in a two-stage approach, first mapping regional land cover followed by forest alliances in closed-canopy tree pixels. Predictor variables were reflectance bands and hyperspectral metrics based on indices, derivatives and absorption-fitting techniques applied to reflectance spectra, with data grouped into summer and three-season (spring, summer, fall) sets. For forest alliances, hyperspectral metrics improved overall accuracy of classifications by 2.9 to 6.4\% relative to classifications based on the original reflectance bands. Multi-seasonal data improved overall accuracy by 1.3 to 6.2\% relative to summer-only data. Using multi-seasonal metrics, the S.F. Bay Area regional classification with 21 alliances had an overall accuracy of 65.7\% (Kappa 0.63), while the Sonoma County classification with 16 alliances had an accuracy of 75.9\% (Kappa 0.72). Most forest alliances had internal variation in lifeform, species and structural properties that increased within-class spectral-temporal variation and complicated discrimination. Despite this challenge, classification accuracies were similar to regional NVC alliance reference data. We conclude that a hyperspectral satellite, with its repeat and global image acquisitions, has strong potential for accurate and economical mapping and monitoring the Earth's vegetation communities.},

  abstract = {Retrieving leaf chlorophyll content at a range of spatio-temporal scales is central to monitoring vegetation productivity, identifying physiological stress and managing biological resources. However, estimating leaf chlorophyll over broad spatial extents using ground-based traditional methods is time and resource heavy. Satellite-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to estimate leaf chlorophyll content, however they are often developed and tested on broadleaf species. Relatively little research has assessed VIs for different leaf structures, particularly needle leaves which represent a large component of boreal forest and significant global ecosystems. This study tested the performance of 47 published VIs for estimating foliar chlorophyll content from different leaf and canopy structures (broadleaf and needle). Coniferous and deciduous sites were selected in Ontario, Canada, representing different dominant vegetation species (Picea mariana and Acer saccharum) and a variety of canopy structures. Leaf reflectance data was collected using an ASD Fieldspec Pro spectroradiometer (400\textendash{}2500nm) for over 300 leaf samples. Canopy reflectance data was acquired from the medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS). At the canopy level, with both leaf types combined, the DD-index showed the strongest relationship with leaf chlorophyll (R2=0.78; RMSE=3.56{$\mu$}g/cm2), despite differences in leaf structure. For needleleaf trees alone the relationship with the top VI was weaker (D[red], R2=0.71; RMSE=2.32{$\mu$}g/cm2). A sensitivity study using simulated VIs from physically-modelled leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy (4-Scale) reflectance was performed in order to further investigate these results and assess the impacts of different background types and leaf area index on the VIs' performance. At the leaf level, the MNDVI8 index showed a strong linearity to changing chlorophyll and negligible difference to leaf structure/type. At canopy level, the best performing VIs were relatively consistent where LAI{$\geq$}4, but responded strongly to differences in background at low canopy coverage (LAI=2). This research provides comprehensive assessments for the use of spectral indices in retrieval of spatially-continuous leaf chlorophyll content at the leaf (MTCI: R2=0.72; p{$<$}0.001) and canopy (DD: R2=0.78; p{$<$}0.001) level for resource management over different spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract = {Sudden oak death, caused by Phytophthora ramorum, has killed millions of oak and tanoak in California since its first detection in 1995. Despite some localized small-scale management, there has been no large-scale attempt to slow the spread of the pathogen in California. Here we use a stochastic spatially explicit model parameterized using data on the spread of P. ramorum to investigate whether and how the epidemic can be controlled. We find that slowing the spread of P. ramorum is now not possible, and has been impossible for a number of years. However, despite extensive cryptic (i.e., presymptomatic) infection and frequent long-range transmission, effective exclusion of the pathogen from large parts of the state could, in principle, have been possible were it to have been started by 2002. This is the approximate date by which sufficient knowledge of P. ramorum epidemiology had accumulated for large-scale management to be realistic. The necessary expenditure would have been very large, but could have been greatly reduced by optimizing the radius within which infected sites are treated and careful selection of sites to treat. In particular, we find that a dynamic strategy treating sites on the epidemic wave front leads to optimal performance. We also find that ``front loading'' the budget, that is, treating very heavily at the start of the management program, would greatly improve control. Our work introduces a framework for quantifying the likelihood of success and risks of failure of management that can be applied to invading pests and pathogens threatening forests worldwide.},

  abstract = {Along mountain roads, rainfall-triggered landslides are typical disasters that cause significant human casualties. Thus, to establish effective mitigation measures, it would be very useful were government agencies and practicing land-use planners to have the capability to make an accurate landslide evaluation. Here, we propose a machine learning methodology for the spatial prediction of rainfall-induced landslides along mountain roads which is based on a random forest classifier (RFC) and a GIS-based dataset. The RFC is used as a supervised learning technique to generalize the classification boundary that separates the input information of ten landslide conditioning factors (slope, aspect, relief amplitude, toposhape, topographic wetness index, distance to roads, distance to rivers, lithology, distance to faults, and rainfall) into two distinctive class labels: 'landslide' and 'non-landslide'. Experimental results with a cross validation process and sensitivity analysis on the RFC model parameters reveal that the proposed model achieves a superior prediction accuracy with an area under the curve \,of 0.92. The RFC significantly outperforms other benchmarking methods, including discriminant analysis, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, relevance vector machines, and support vector machines. Based on our experimental outcome and comparative analysis, we strongly recommend the RFC as a very capable tool for spatial modeling of rainfall-induced landslides.},

  abstract = {Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis. Given its natural presence in brackish waters, there is a need to develop operational forecast models that can sufficiently predict the bacterium's spatial and temporal variation. This work attempted to develop V. parahaemolyticus prediction models using frequently measured time-indexed and -lagged water quality measures. Models were built using a large data set ({$<$}em{$>$}n{$<$}/em{$>$}\,=\,1,043) of surface water samples from 2007 to 2010 previously analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay. Water quality variables were classified as time indexed, 1-month lag, and 2-month lag. Tobit regression models were used to account for V. parahaemolyticus measures below the limit of quantification and to simultaneously estimate the presence and abundance of the bacterium. Models were evaluated using cross-validation and metrics that quantify prediction bias and uncertainty. Presence classification models containing only one type of water quality parameter (e.g., temperature) performed poorly, while models with additional water quality parameters (i.e., salinity, clarity, and dissolved oxygen) performed well. Lagged variable models performed similarly to time-indexed models, and lagged variables occasionally contained a predictive power that was independent of or superior to that of time-indexed variables. Abundance estimation models were less effective, primarily due to a restricted number of samples with abundances above the limit of quantification. These findings indicate that an operational {$<$}em{$>$}in situ{$<$}/em{$>$} prediction model is attainable but will require a variety of water quality measurements and that lagged measurements will be particularly useful for forecasting. Future work will expand variable selection for prediction models and extend the spatial-temporal extent of predictions by using geostatistical interpolation techniques.
{$<$}strong{$>$}IMPORTANCE{$<$}/strong{$>$} Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the leading causes of seafood-borne illness in the United States and across the globe. Exposure often occurs from the consumption of raw shellfish. Despite public health concerns, there have been only sporadic efforts to develop environmental prediction and forecast models for the bacterium preharvest. This analysis used commonly sampled water quality measurements of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and clarity to develop models for V. parahaemolyticus in surface water. Predictors also included measurements taken months before water was tested for the bacterium. Results revealed that the use of multiple water quality measurements is necessary for satisfactory prediction performance, challenging current efforts to manage the risk of infection based upon water temperature alone. The results also highlight the potential advantage of including historical water quality measurements. This analysis shows promise and lays the groundwork for future operational prediction and forecast models.},

With the increased area of infestation, ecological, environmental and economic concerns about gypsy moth disturbance remain significant, necessitating coordinated, repeatable and comprehensive monitoring of the areas affected. In this study, our primary objective was to estimate the magnitude of defoliation using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for a gypsy moth outbreak that occurred in the US central Appalachian Mountains in 2000 and 2001. We focused on determining the appropriate spectral MODIS indices and temporal compositing method to best monitor the effects of gypsy moth defoliation. We tested MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and two versions of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDIIb6 and NDIIb7, using the channels centered on 1640~nm and 2130~nm respectively) for their capacity to map defoliation as estimated by ground observations. In addition, we evaluated three temporal resolutions: daily, 8-day and 16-day data. We validated the results through quantitative comparison to Landsat based defoliation estimates and traditional sketch maps. Our MODIS based defoliation estimates based on NDIIb6 and NDIIb7 closely matched Landsat defoliation estimates derived from field data as well as sketch maps. We conclude that daily MODIS data can be used with confidence to monitor insect defoliation on an annual time scale, at least for larger patches ({$>$}0.63~km2). Eight-day and 16-day MODIS composites may be of lesser use due to the ephemeral character of disturbance by the gypsy moth.},

Choosing the most important features is an essential step for knowledge discovery in many areas of biomedical informatics. The increased popularity of feature selection methods and their frequent utilisation raise challenging new questions about the interpretability and stability of feature selection techniques. In this study, we compared the behaviour of ten state-of-the-art filter methods for feature selection in terms of their stability, similarity, and influence on prediction performance. All of the experiments were conducted on eight two-class datasets from biomedical areas. While entropy-based feature selection appears to be the most stable, the feature selection techniques yielding the highest prediction performance are minimum redundance maximum relevance method and feature selection based on Bhattacharyya distance. In general, univariate feature selection techniques perform similarly to or even better than more complex multivariate feature selection techniques with high-dimensional datasets. However, with more complex and smaller datasets multivariate methods slightly outperform univariate techniques.},

The performance of the proposed methods is comparatively analysed from the stability and predictive performance point of view. As the obtained results indicate the choice of the filter FS in the first stage has strong influence on the resulting stability.

Reduction of data dimensionality through feature selection reduces computational time, complexity and provide better interpretability. Besides well established feature selection approaches such as filter, wrapper and embedded approach, novel methodology emerged recently: ensemble feature selection. This approach utilize diversity to select final feature subset. In this paper, we proposed four novel heterogeneous ensemble methods based on eight basal feature selection techniques in first stage and modified Borda count voting schemes in the second stage. The proposed methods were evaluated on four artificial datasets achieving significantly higher index of success than conventional feature selection techniques.},

Recently, ensemble FS has emerged as a new methodology that promises to improve FS robustness and performance. In this paper, we propose several ensemble FS methods built on voting aggregation schemes such as plurality vote, single transferable vote, Borda count, and novel weighted Borda count. Additionally, we present the new concept of clustering FS methods prior to building ensembles using a mean-shift clustering algorithm. The proposed methods are examined using three accuracy measures: the ability to correctly identify relevant features, FS stability, and influence on classification. The ensembles and clustered ensembles based on a weighted Borda count show very balanced performance, achieving quality results in all investigated measures and outperforming the other methods examined.},

  abstract = {Aim The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict biological invasions is a rapidly developing area of ecology. However, most studies investigating SDMs typically ignore prediction errors and instead focus on regions where native distributions correctly predict invaded ranges. We investigated the ecological significance of prediction errors using reciprocal comparisons between the predicted invaded and native range of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) (hereafter called the fire ant). We questioned whether fire ants occupy similar environments in their native and introduced range, how the environments that fire ants occupy in their introduced range changed through time relative to their native range, and where fire ant propagules are likely to have originated. Location We developed models for South America and the conterminous United States (US) of America. Methods We developed models using the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and 12 environmental layers. Occurrence data from the native range in South America were used to predict the introduced range in the US and vice versa. Further, time-series data recording the invasion of fire ants in the US were used to predict the native range. Results Native range occurrences under-predicted the invasive potential of fire ants, whereas occurrence data from the US over-predicted the southern boundary of the native range. Secondly, introduced fire ants initially established in environments similar to those in their native range, but subsequently invaded harsher environments. Time-series data suggest that fire ant propagules originated near the southern limit of their native range. Conclusions Our findings suggest that fire ants from a peripheral native population established in an environment similar to their native environment, and then ultimately expanded into environments in which they are not found in their native range. We argue that reciprocal comparisons between predicted native and invaded ranges will facilitate a better understanding of the biogeography of invasive and native species and of the role of SDMs in predicting future distributions.},

  abstract = {Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.], Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a native defoliating insect with an important disturbance role in the eastern boreal forests of North America. With an extensive history of outbreaks and associated impacts on forest structural changes and timber supply, the mapping of spruce budworm defoliation has been of major management importance. In this study we assessed the ability of high spatial resolution digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) data to predict cumulative defoliation as well as basal area and merchantable volume in spruce budworm host stands in the Gordon Cosens Forest south of Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. To do so, DAP derived structural and spectral metrics were incorporated to implement a stratified sampling design to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of field surveying. Standard forest inventory measurements including diameter and height, as well as ocular and branch level defoliation assessments were undertaken on thirty 400 m2 radius plots. A partial least squares analysis was performed to determine whether structural metrics from a DAP point cloud could be influenced by spruce budworm defoliation, as well as determine the relative effectiveness of spectral (e.g. mean NDVI) vs. structural (e.g. 90th percentile of height) metrics, or their combination, for predicting cumulative defoliation. Results indicated that spectral metrics were the most effective for predicting cumulative defoliation (R2 = 0.79), while structural metrics were the least effective (R2 = 0.49). Metrics characterizing variance of the spectral values were found to be the most important predictors. Structural metrics and linear regression were also used to estimate landscape-level volume and basal area per hectare yielding R2 = 0.80 and R2 = 0.90, respectively. Outcomes of this analysis indicate that DAP-derived spectral metrics were more capable of modeling cumulative defoliation, while structural metrics were effective for landscape-level estimations of standard forest inventory attributes. This analysis indicated that the provision of both spectral and structural metrics from a single aerial imagery survey has potential to enhance defoliation monitoring and forest attribute modeling at a landscape-level.},

It also provides a flexible method for spatial prediction using non-normal data and includes universal kriging and indicator kriging as special cases. Examples are given, including one where the focus is on comparing treatments in a designed experiment in which spatial correlation is present, and two others where spatial prediction or mapping is the desired goal.

  abstract = {In bioinformatics, the vast of multi-label type of datasets, including clinical text, gene, and protein data, need to be categorized. Specifically, due to the redundant or irrelevant features in bioinformatics data, the performance of multi-label classifiers will be limited, and therefore, selecting effective features from the feature space is necessary. However, most of the proposed methods, which aimed at dealing with multi-label feature selection problem in the past few years, only adopt a simple and direct strategy that transforms the multi-label feature selection problem into more single-label ones and ignore correlations among different labels. In this paper, a novel algorithm named ensemble embedded feature selection (EEFS) is proposed to handle multi-label bioinformatics data learning problem in a more effective and efficient way. The EEFS does not only explicitly find out the correlations among labels, but it can also adequately utilize the label correlations by multi-label classifiers and evaluation measures. Furthermore, it can reduce the accumulated errors of data itself by employing an ensemble method. The experimental results on five multi-label bioinformatics datasets show that our algorithm achieves significant superiority over the other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This paper redefines evaluation as a multi-dimensional and multi-perspective concept, and proposes a more complete framework for identifying and measuring the effectiveness of modelling that serves the new paradigm. Under this framework, evaluation considers a broader set of success criteria, and emphasises the importance of contextual factors in determining the relevance and outcome of the criteria. These evaluation criteria are grouped into eight categories: project efficiency, model accessibility, credibility, saliency, legitimacy, satisfaction, application, and impact. Evaluation should be part of an iterative and adaptive process that attempts to improve model-based outcomes and foster pathways to better futures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

Regression and classification models were built based on reference data from 50 field plots and Sentinel-2 satellite images from three acquisition dates. Three machine-learning (ML) methods were tested: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). Regression models predicted stands defoliation with moderate accuracy. R2 values for regression models amounted to 0.53, 0.57, 0.57 for kNN, RF and SVM, accordingly. Analogically, the following values of normalized root mean squared error were obtained: 12.2\%, 11.9\% and 11.6\%. Overall accuracies for two-class classification models were 78\%, 75\%, 78\% for kNN, RF and SVM methods. The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index VIs were found to be most robust defoliation predictors regardless of the ML method.

The onset of the "big data" era, however, has lead to the traditional Gaussian process being computationally infeasible for modern spatial data. As such, various alternatives to the full Gaussian process that are more amenable to handling big spatial data have been proposed. These modern methods often exploit low rank structures and/or multi-core and multi-threaded computing environments to facilitate computation. This study provides, first, an introductory overview of several methods for analyzing large spatial data. Second, this study describes the results of a predictive competition among the described methods as implemented by different groups with strong expertise in the methodology. Specifically, each research group was provided with two training datasets (one simulated and one observed) along with a set of prediction locations. Each group then wrote their own implementation of their method to produce predictions at the given location and each which was subsequently run on a common computing environment. The methods were then compared in terms of various predictive diagnostics. Supplementary materials regarding implementation details of the methods and code are available for this article online.},

As Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are now both operating in twin mode, they can provide an unprecedented data source to build dense spatial and temporal high-resolution time series across a variety of wavelengths. This study investigates (i) the ability of the individual sensors and (ii) their joint potential to delineate forest cover for study sites in two highly varied landscapes located in Germany (temperate dense mixed forests) and South Africa (open savanna woody vegetation and forest plantations). We used multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and single time steps of Sentinel-2 data in combination to derive accurate forest/non-forest (FNF) information via machine-learning classifiers. The forest classification accuracies were 90.9\% and 93.2\% for South Africa and Thuringia, respectively, estimated while using autocorrelation corrected spatial cross-validation (CV) for the fused data set. Sentinel-1 only classifications provided the lowest overall accuracy of 87.5\%, while Sentinel-2 based classifications led to higher accuracies of 91.9\%. Sentinel-2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)) and the lower spectrum of the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series were found to be most distinctive in the detection of forest cover. In contrast to homogenous forests sites, Sentinel-1 time series information improved forest cover predictions in open savanna-like environments with heterogeneous regional features. The presented approach proved to be robust and it displayed the benefit of fusing optical and SAR data at high spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Analyzing ecological data often requires modeling the autocorrelation created by spatial and temporal processes. Many seemingly disparate statistical methods used to account for autocorrelation can be expressed as regression models that include basis functions. Basis functions also enable ecologists to modify a wide range of existing ecological models in order to account for autocorrelation, which can improve inference and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, understanding the properties of basis functions is essential for evaluating the fit of spatial or time-series models, detecting a hidden form of collinearity, and analyzing large data sets. We present important concepts and properties related to basis functions and illustrate several tools and techniques ecologists can use when modeling autocorrelation in ecological data.},

  abstract = {Hundreds of species in one of Australia's dominant plant families, the Myrtaceae, are at risk from the invasive pathogenic fungus Austropuccinia psidii. Since its arrival in Australia in 2010, native plant communities have been severely affected, with highly susceptible species likely to become extinct from recurring infections. While severe impact on Australian native and plantation forestry has been predicted, the lemon myrtle industry is already under threat. Commercial cultivars of lemon myrtle (Backhousia citriodora) are highly susceptible to A. psidii. Detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks is currently only possible by eye, which is costly and subject to human bias. This study aims at developing a proof-of-concept for automated, non-biased classification of healthy (na{\"i}ve), fungicide-treated and diseased lemon myrtle trees by means of their spectral reflectance signatures. From a lemon myrtle plantation, spectral signatures of fungicide-treated and untreated leaves were collected using a portable field spectrometer. A third class of spectra, from na{\"i}ve lemon myrtle leaves that had not been exposed to A. psidii, was collected from a botanical garden. Reflectance spectra in their primary form and their first-order derivatives were used to train a random forest classifier resulting in an overall accuracy of 78\% (kappa = 0.68) for primary spectra and 95\% (kappa = 0.92) for first-order derivative-transformed spectra. Thus, an optical sensor-based discrimination, using spectral reflectance signatures of this as yet uninvestigated pathosystem, seems technically feasible. This study provides a foundation for the development of automated, sensor-based detection and monitoring systems for myrtle rust.},

  abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as ``knowledge engines'' in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality\textemdash{}especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.},

The present study evaluated the ability of canopy reflectance spectroscopy at the range from 350 to 2500 nm to predict GY in a large panel (368 genotypes) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through multivariate ridge regression models. Plants were treated under three water regimes in the Mediterranean conditions of central Chile: severe water stress (SWS, rain fed), mild water stress (MWS; one irrigation event around booting) and full irrigation (FI) with mean GYs of 1655, 4739, and 7967 kg{$\bullet$}ha-1, respectively. Models developed from reflectance data during anthesis and grain filling under all water regimes explained between 77\% and 91\% of the GY variability, with the highest values in SWS condition. When individual models were used to predict yield in the rest of the trials assessed, models fitted during anthesis under MWS performed best. Combined models using data from different water regimes and each phenological stage were used to predict grain yield, and the coefficients of determination (R2) increased to 89.9\% and 92.0\% for anthesis and grain filling, respectively. The model generated during anthesis in MWS was the best at predicting yields when it was applied to other conditions. Comparisons against conventional reflectance indices were made, showing lower predictive abilities. It was concluded that a Ridge Regression Model using a data set based on spectral reflectance at anthesis or grain filling represents an effective method to predict grain yield in genotypes under different water regimes.},

The sites included boreal forest, temperate coniferous forest, temperate deciduous forest, tropical rainforest, grassland, savanna, and desert biomes. Differences and similarities in sensitivity to vegetation conditions were compared among various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). All VIs showed a qualitative relationship to variations in vegetation. However, there were significant differences among the VIs over desert, grassland, and forested biomes. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was sensitive to and responded primarily to the highly absorbing red reflectance band, while other indices such (is the soil and atmosphere resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were more responsive to variations in the near-infrared (NIR) band. As a result, we found the NDVI to mimic red reflectances and saturate over the forested sites while the SARVI, by contrast, did not saturate and followed variations in NIR refleetances. In the arid and semiarid biomes, the NDVI was much more sensitive to canopy background variations than the SARVI. Maximum differences among vegetation index behavior occurred over the evergreen needleleaf forest sites relative to the deciduous broadleaf forests and drier, grassland, and shrub sites. These differences appear to be useful in complementing the NDVI for improved monitoring of vegetation, with the NDVI sensitive to fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation and the SARVI more sensitive to structural canopy parameters such as leaf area index and leaf morphology.},

  abstract = {Feature extraction based on ridge regression (FERR) is proposed in this article. In FERR, a feature vector is defined in each spectral band using the mean of all classes in that dimension. Then, it is modelled using a linear combination of its farthest neighbours from among other defined feature vectors. The representation coefficients obtained by solving the ridge regression model compose the projection matrix for feature extraction. FERR can extract each desired number of features while the other methods such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) have limitations in the number of extracted features. Experimental results on four popular real hyperspectral images show that the efficiency of FERR is superior to those of other supervised feature extraction methods in small sample-size situations. For example, for the Indian Pines dataset, the comparison between the highest average classification accuracies achieved by different feature extraction methods using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and 16 training samples per class shows that FERR is 7\% more accurate than nonparametric weighted feature extraction and is also 9\% better than GDA. LDA, having the singularity problem in the small sample-size situations, has 40\% less accuracy than FERR. The experiments show that generally the performance of FERR using the SVM classifier is better than when using the maximum likelihood classifier.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest condition has important implications for biodiversity, climate change and human needs. Structural features of forests can serve as useful indicators of forest condition and have the potential to be assessed with remotely sensed imagery, which can provide quantitative information on forest ecosystems at high temporal and spatial resolutions. Herein, we investigate the utility of remote sensing for assessing, predicting and mapping two important forest structural features, stem density and basal area, in tropical, littoral forests in southeastern Madagascar. We analysed the relationships of basal area and stem density measurements to the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and radiance measurements in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Strong relationships were identified among all of the individual bands and field based measurements of basal area (p{$<$}0.01) while there were weak and insignificant relationships among spectral response and stem density measurements. NDVI was not significantly correlated with basal area but was strongly and significantly correlated with stem density (r=-0.69, p{$<$}0.01) when using a subset of the data, which represented extreme values. We used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict basal area from radiance values in bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 and to produce a predictive map of basal area for the entire forest landscape. The ANNs produced strong and significant relationships between predicted and actual measures of basal area using a jackknife method (r=0.79, p{$<$}0.01) and when using a larger data set (r=0.82, p{$<$}0.01). The map of predicted basal area produced by the ANN was assessed in relation to a pre-existing map of forest condition derived from a semi-quantitative field assessment. The predictive map of basal area provided finer detail on stand structural heterogeneity, captured known climatic influences on forest structure and displayed trends of basal area associated with degree of human accessibility. These findings demonstrate the utility of ANNs for integrating satellite data from the Landsat ETM+ spectral bands 3, 4, 5 and 7 with limited field survey data to assess patterns in basal area at the landscape scale.},

  abstract = {Epiphyllous liverworts form a special group of bryophytes that primarily grow on leaves of understory vascular plants, occurring in constantly moist and warm evergreen forest in tropical and subtropical regions. They are very sensitive to climate change and environmental pollution. Previous studies have focused largely on microhabitat preferences of epiphyllous liverworts and demonstrated the importance of climate factors such as humidity, temperature and light. However, little is known about the relationship between distribution of epiphyllous liverworts and macro-habitat factors at broad spatial scales. Here, we predicated the distribution of epiphyllous liverworts in China based on topographic and bioclimatic variables, as well as satellite-derived vegetation indices at a 1km spatial resolution using presence-only ecological niche models. We used the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistic (TSS) to validate the models, and then used the Wilcoxon paired test to compare model performances. Furthermore, we applied the jackknife test to identify the important factors affecting predictions. Our results showed that the highest accuracy (i.e., AUC=0.98 and TSS=0.93) in predicting epiphyllous liverworts was achieved by the model that combined climatic and remotely sensed vegetation variables. The satellite-derived annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as well as the annual mean and minimum Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) emerged as the most important predictors of distribution patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, while climatic variables such as precipitation in the wettest quarter and temperature of the coldest quarter were of ancillary importance. The significant contributions of NDVI and NDWI in defining the distribution range and spatial patterns of epiphyllous liverworts, and the strong relationship between this species and evergreen forest implies that epiphyllous liverworts may be a useful indicator for forest degradation or integrity at broad spatial scales.},

Finally, model testing and evaluation should focus on well-predicted presences, and less on efficient prediction of absences; a k-fold regional cross-validation test is discussed.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark\textendash{}recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

This overview article introduces the difficulties that arise with high-dimensional data in the context of the very familiar linear statistical model: we give a taste of what can nevertheless be achieved when the parameter vector of interest is sparse, that is, contains many zero elements. We describe other ways of identifying low-dimensional subspaces of the data space that contain all useful information. The topic of classification is then reviewed along with the problem of identifying, from within a very large set, the variables that help to classify observations. Brief mention is made of the visualization of high-dimensional data and ways to handle computational problems in Bayesian analysis are described.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose to estimate tree defoliation from ground-level RGB photos with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Tree defoliation is usually assessed with field campaigns, where experts estimate multiple tree health indicators per sample site. Campaigns span entire countries to come up with a holistic, nationwide picture of forest health. Surveys are very laborious, expensive, time-consuming and need a large number of experts. We aim at making the monitoring process more efficient by casting tree defoliation estimation as an image interpretation problem. What makes this task challenging is the strong variance in lighting, viewpoint, scale, tree species, and defoliation types. Instead of accounting for each factor separately through explicit modeling, we learn a joint distribution directly from a large set of annotated training images following the end-to-end learning paradigm of deep learning. The proposed workflow works as follows: (i) Human experts visit individual trees in forests distributed all over Switzerland, (ii) acquire one photo per tree with an off-the-shelf, hand-held RGB camera, and (iii) assign a defoliation value. The CNN approach is (iv) trained on a subset of the images with expert defoliation assessments and (v) tested on a hold-out part to check predicted values against ground truth. We evaluate our supervised method on three data sets with different level of difficulty acquired in Swiss forests and achieve an average mean absolute error (avgMAE) of 7.6\% for the joint data set after cross-validation. Comparison to a group of human experts on one of the data sets shows that our CNN approach performs only 0.9\% points worse. We show that tree defoliation estimation from ground-level RGB images with a CNN works well and achieves performance close to human experts.},

  doi = {10/gf7hh7},
  abstract = {Mediterranean maquis vegetation is highly biodiverse, but widespread grazing poses a challenge for management and conservation. We sampled woody and herbaceous plants separately on a limestone mountain with strong mesic-xeric gradients in Tunisia's Parc National de L'Ichkeul, assessed grazing pressure (on a scale of 1\textendash{}3), and asked whether grazing had a significant effect on plant compositional abundance before and after controlling for environmental covariates. Sites on the more mesic lakeside face of the mountain were most compositionally unique, and forbs contributed most to the herbaceous beta-diversity on the mountain. We used variance partitioning to separate the collective and individual effects of the abiotic environment, grazing, human activity, and space on herbaceous and woody beta-diversity. However, the individual effect of grazing on overall plant community composition was confounded with space, due to the spatially autocorrelated grazing pressure on the mountain. Importantly, we found that herbaceous and woody communities responded differently to increasing levels of grazing intensity: herbaceous beta-diversity was highest between sites with no grazing pressure, while woody beta-diversity peaked under light grazing. Herbaceous community composition was sensitive to any intensity of grazing pressure, and biotic homogenization occured under moderate-to-high grazing pressure. On the other hand, woody community composition remained relatively similar under no to light grazing pressure, but differed under moderate-to-heavy grazing. Using a one-way permutational analysis of variance analysis, we showed that grazing had a significant effect when controlling for abiotic and spatial covariates. Our findings offer insight into the effects of grazing on maquis vegetation at Jebel Ichkeul, acting as a microcosm of similar conservation and management issues elsewhere in the Mediterranean. We suggest that a combination of monitoring and carefully controlled grazing may enhance plant diversity and maintain the region's biodiverse maquis vegetation, potentially maintaining a key climate refugium for vulnerable endemic species. Importantly, our study provides a useful baseline of the plant assemblages at Jebel Ichkeul with which to compare future vegetation changes.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic stress and disturbance of forest ecosystems (FES) has been increasing at all scales from local to global. In rapidly changing environments, in-situ terrestrial FES monitoring approaches have made tremendous progress but they are intensive and often integrate subjective indicators for forest health (FH). Remote sensing (RS) bridges the gaps of these limitations, by monitoring indicators of FH on different spatio-temporal scales, and in a cost-effective, rapid, repetitive and objective manner. In this paper, we provide an overview of the definitions of FH, discussing the drivers, processes, stress and adaptation mechanisms of forest plants, and how we can observe FH with RS. We introduce the concept of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) in the context of FH monitoring and discuss the prospects, limitations and constraints. Stress, disturbances and resource limitations can cause changes in FES taxonomic, structural and functional diversity; we provide examples how the ST/STV approach can be used for monitoring these FES characteristics. We show that RS based assessments of FH indicators using the ST/STV approach is a competent, affordable, repetitive and objective technique for monitoring. Even though the possibilities for observing the taxonomic diversity of animal species is limited with RS, the taxonomy of forest tree species can be recorded with RS, even though its accuracy is subject to certain constraints. RS has proved successful for monitoring the impacts from stress on structural and functional diversity. In particular, it has proven to be very suitable for recording the short-term dynamics of stress on FH, which cannot be cost-effectively recorded using in-situ methods. This paper gives an overview of the ST/STV approach, whereas the second paper of this series concentrates on discussing in-situ terrestrial monitoring, in-situ RS approaches and RS sensors and techniques for measuring ST/STV for FH.},

However, nowadays such diagnostics are long and difficult when only made from visual symptom observation, and very expensive and damaging when based on root or stem tissue chemical analysis. As an alternative, we propose in this study to evaluate the potential of hyperspectral reflectance data to help detecting the disease efficiently without destruction of tissues. This study focuses on the calibration of a statistical model of discrimination between several stages of Ganoderma attack on oil palm trees, based on field hyperspectral measurements at tree scale. Field protocol and measurements are first described. Then, combinations of pre-processing, partial least square regression and linear discriminant analysis are tested on about hundred samples to prove the efficiency of canopy reflectance in providing information about the plant sanitary status. A robust algorithm is thus derived, allowing classifying oil-palm in a 4-level typology, based on disease severity from healthy to critically sick stages, with a global performance close to 94\%. Moreover, this model discriminates sick from healthy trees with a confidence level of almost 98\%. Applications and further improvements of this experiment are finally discussed.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

  abstract = {Climate change is widely expected to pose a threat to many of Earth's plant and animal species. Based on climate models, a multitude of studies project that certain species will not be able to migrate fast enough to keep up with changing environmental conditions, presenting a greater risk of their possible extinction. However, many of these studies are based on correlative climate niche models that represent the current living conditions of species and may not consider their ability to tolerate projected changes in future climate, including the stimulative effects of rising CO2 for plant growth and drought tolerance. SDMs also are not usually run with sufficiently detailed spatial data to account for refugia. These and other aspects of model-based niche studies can potentially combine to mischaracterize the risk to species due to climate change. Even a SDM that perfectly predicts future equilibrium geographic range following climate change, however, does not yield a direct estimate of extinction risk. The key question is ``What is the transient response to a climate disequilibrium situation?'' The concept of relaxation is introduced to evaluate time-scales for responses at the trailing edge of species' ranges. Simulation of relaxation at a forest ecotone shows the relaxation response in some cases can be hundreds of years. A classification of relaxation responses based on tolerance and dispersal ability is proposed as a second stage analysis for SDM studies.},

However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12\%. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.},

This paper provides a survey of current biomass estimation methods using remote sensing data and discusses four critical issues \textendash{} collection of field-based biomass reference data, extraction and selection of suitable variables from remote sensing data, identification of proper algorithms to develop biomass estimation models, and uncertainty analysis to refine the estimation procedure. Additionally, we discuss the impacts of scales on biomass estimation performance and describe a general biomass estimation procedure. Although optical sensor and radar data have been primary sources for AGB estimation, data saturation is an important factor resulting in estimation uncertainty. LIght Detection and Ranging (lidar) can remove data saturation, but limited availability of lidar data prevents its extensive application. This literature survey has indicated the limitations of using single-sensor data for biomass estimation and the importance of integrating multi-sensor/scale remote sensing data to produce accurate estimates over large areas. More research is needed to extract a vertical vegetation structure (e.g. canopy height) from interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) or optical stereo images to incorporate it into horizontal structures (e.g. canopy cover) in biomass estimation modeling.},

Several studies about taxonomy, impact and epidemiology of these fungi have been conducted in previous years, which have provided useful information and have raised new issues. These diseases produce a considerable impact on plantations resulting in significant economic losses. The main aims of this study are to increase the knowledge of the potential of genetic exchange and the relative aggressiveness of these organisms that can persist in healthy tissues of asymptomatic trees. A collection of 250 isolates among which are 149 strains collected from Pinus radiata plantations in Basque Country (Spain) and 101 strains from different countries was included in this work. Mating type ratios were analysed and compared using the structure of the MAT locus (MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2-1). Inoculations of Pinus radiata seedlings were performed in a biosafety greenhouse (P2) to confirm pathogenicity of isolates and compare their aggressiveness. The frequency of occurrence of both idiomorphs of D.~sapinea in Basque Country isolates was close to 1:1, however, for collection of isolates of this fungus from around the world, the ratio was 1:2. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the two mating types in the Basque Country was random. Despite no detection of a sexual state, these results could suggest sexual reproduction behaviour. The pathogenicity of all strains in the collection was confirmed. Although aggressiveness (in terms of lesion lengths resulting from inoculation) varied greatly, no statistically significant effects of MAT type or pathogen species were detected.},

In this paper, we first review the sources of information and different approaches (frequentist and Bayesian) to model the distribution of a species. We also discuss the Integrated Nested Laplace approximation as a tool with which to obtain marginal posterior distributions of the parameters involved in these models. We finally discuss some important statistical issues that arise when researchers use species data: the presence of a temporal effect (presenting different spatial and spatio-temporal structures), preferential sampling, spatial misalignment, non-stationarity, imperfect detection, and the excess of zeros.},

The present work analyses the spatial and temporal changes in forest cover in Moncayo Natural Park (Spain) from 1987 to 2010 using remote sensing techniques, geographical information systems (GIS) and quantitative indices of landscape ecology. Four Landsat images were used to map nine representative land cover categories in this preserved area in both years. The overall classification accuracies in land cover cartographies in 1987 and 2010 were 87.65\% and 84.56\%, respectively. Landscape metrics obtained at the landscape level show an increase in fragmentation and, as a result, an increase in landscape spatial diversity. Focusing on the class level, the results show a forest expansion of sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), two important bioclimatic indicators in this natural park, because they are the southernmost locations for these species in Europe. The decrease of mainly introduced pine forest and the transformation of mixed shrub areas into natural forested areas explain the aforementioned increase in fragmentation. These results are in agreement with the strategies for nature conservation designed by forest managers during the period evaluated.},

The Random Forest machine learning algorithm may aid carbon mapping applications using remotely-sensed data. However, Random Forest has never been compared to traditional and potentially more reliable techniques such as regionally stratified sampling and upscaling, and it has rarely been employed with spatial data. Here, we evaluated the performance of Random Forest in upscaling airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-based carbon estimates compared to the stratification approach over a 16-million hectare focal area of the Western Amazon. We considered two runs of Random Forest, both with and without spatial contextual modeling by including\textemdash{}in the latter case\textemdash{}x, and y position directly in the model. In each case, we set aside 8 million hectares (i.e., half of the focal area) for validation; this rigorous test of Random Forest went above and beyond the internal validation normally compiled by the algorithm (i.e., called ``out-of-bag''), which proved insufficient for this spatial application. In this heterogeneous region of Northern Peru, the model with spatial context was the best preforming run of Random Forest, and explained 59\% of LiDAR-based carbon estimates within the validation area, compared to 37\% for stratification or 43\% by Random Forest without spatial context. With the 60\% improvement in explained variation, RMSE against validation LiDAR samples improved from 33 to 26 Mg C ha-1 when using Random Forest with spatial context. Our results suggest that spatial context should be considered when using Random Forest, and that doing so may result in substantially improved carbon stock modeling for purposes of climate change mitigation.},

  abstract = {Defoliation by herbivorous insects is a widespread forest disturbance driver, affecting global forest health and ecosystem dynamics. Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales. However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied. Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared. These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales. During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest. We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity. LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects. In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures. Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37\% vs. Adj. R-squared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11\%). The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46\%). Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level. Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models.},

  abstract = {Riparian forests are critically endangered many anthropogenic pressures and natural hazards. The importance of riparian zones has been acknowledged by European Directives, involving multi-scale monitoring. The use of this very-high-resolution and hyperspatial imagery in a multi-temporal approach is an emerging topic. The trend is reinforced by the recent and rapid growth of the use of the unmanned aerial system (UAS), which has prompted the development of innovative methodology. Our study proposes a methodological framework to explore how a set of multi-temporal images acquired during a vegetative period can differentiate some of the deciduous riparian forest species and their health conditions. More specifically, the developed approach intends to identify, through a process of variable selection, which variables derived from UAS imagery and which scale of image analysis are the most relevant to our objectives.The methodological framework is applied to two study sites to describe the riparian forest through two fundamental characteristics: the species composition and the health condition. These characteristics were selected not only because of their use as proxies for the riparian zone ecological integrity but also because of their use for river management.The comparison of various scales of image analysis identified the smallest object-based image analysis (OBIA) objects (ca. 1 m2) as the most relevant scale. Variables derived from spectral information (bands ratios) were identified as the most appropriate, followed by variables related to the vertical structure of the forest. Classification results show good overall accuracies for the species composition of the riparian forest (five classes, 79.5 and 84.1 \% for site 1 and site 2). The classification scenario regarding the health condition of the black alders of the site 1 performed the best (90.6 \%).The quality of the classification models developed with a UAS-based, cost-effective, and semi-automatic approach competes successfully with those developed using more expensive imagery, such as multi-spectral and hyperspectral airborne imagery. The high overall accuracy results obtained by the classification of the diseased alders open the door to applications dedicated to monitoring of the health conditions of riparian forest. Our methodological framework will allow UAS users to manage large imagery metric datasets derived from those dense time series.},

The vital aspect of this algorithm is the automatic determination of NN architectures during the FS process. Our algorithm uses a constructive approach involving correlation information in selecting features and determining NN architectures. We call this algorithm as constructive approach for FS (CAFS). The aim of using correlation information in CAFS is to encourage the search strategy for selecting less correlated (distinct) features if they enhance accuracy of NNs. Such an encouragement will reduce redundancy of information resulting in compact NN architectures. We evaluate the performance of CAFS on eight benchmark classification problems. The experimental results show the essence of CAFS in selecting features with compact NN architectures.},

  abstract = {Environmental niche modeling (ENM) is commonly used to develop probabilistic maps of species distribution. Among available ENM techniques, MaxEnt has become one of the most popular tools for modeling species distribution, with hundreds of peer-reviewed articles published each year. MaxEnt's popularity is mainly due to the use of a graphical interface and automatic parameter configuration capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that using the default automatic configuration may not be always appropriate because it can produce non-optimal models; particularly when dealing with a small number of species presence points. Thus, the recommendation is to evaluate the best potential combination of parameters (feature classes and regularization multiplier) to select the most appropriate model. In this work we reviewed 244 articles published between 2013 and 2015 to assess whether researchers are following recommendations to avoid using the default parameter configuration when dealing with small sample sizes, or if they are using MaxEnt as a ``black box tool.'' Our results show that in only 16\% of analyzed articles authors evaluated best feature classes, in 6.9\% evaluated best regularization multipliers, and in a meager 3.7\% evaluated simultaneously both parameters before producing the definitive distribution model. We analyzed 20 articles to quantify the potential differences in resulting outputs when using software default parameters instead of the alternative best model. Results from our analysis reveal important differences between the use of default parameters and the best model approach, especially in the total area identified as suitable for the assessed species and the specific areas that are identified as suitable by both modelling approaches. These results are worrying, because publications are potentially reporting over-complex or over-simplistic models that can undermine the applicability of their results. Of particular importance are studies used to inform policy making. Therefore, researchers, practitioners, reviewers and editors need to be very judicious when dealing with MaxEnt, particularly when the modelling process is based on small sample sizes.},

Ecological and land use gradients play a major role in the origin and maintenance of this diversity, yet a comprehensive synthesis of the corresponding large body of literature is still missing. We searched all ISI-listed journals for tropical gradient studies. From the resulting 1023 studies, we extracted study-specific information, and analyzed it using descriptive analytical tools and GLMs. Our results reveal that dry tropical areas are vastly understudied compared to their humid counterparts. The same holds true for large parts of Africa, but also the Philippines and the South Asian region. However, we also found that (applied) research output of developing tropical countries is nowadays on par with the output of developed countries. Vegetation and elevation were the most studied response variable and gradient, respectively. By contrast, inconspicous organisms such as oribatid mites and edaphic gradients were largely missing in the literature. Regarding biodiversity, tropical gradient studies dealt extensively with species richness and ecosystem diversity, but much less with genetic diversity. We encourage a wider use of modern statistical learning tools such as non-linear (spatio-temporal) regression and classification techniques, and simulations. Finally, we would embrace an even further development of synergies between applied and basic research and between researchers based in developed and in tropical countries.},

  abstract = {Background
The selection, development, or comparison of machine learning methods in data mining can be a difficult task based on the target problem and goals of a particular study. Numerous publicly available real-world and simulated benchmark datasets have emerged from different sources, but their organization and adoption as standards have been inconsistent. As such, selecting and curating specific benchmarks remains an unnecessary burden on machine learning practitioners and data scientists.

Results
The present study introduces an accessible, curated, and developing public benchmark resource to facilitate identification of the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning methodologies. We compare meta-features among the current set of benchmark datasets in this resource to characterize the diversity of available data. Finally, we apply a number of established machine learning methods to the entire benchmark suite and analyze how datasets and algorithms cluster in terms of performance. From this study, we find that existing benchmarks lack the diversity to properly benchmark machine learning algorithms, and there are several gaps in benchmarking problems that still need to be considered.

Conclusions
This work represents another important step towards understanding the limitations of popular benchmarking suites and developing a resource that connects existing benchmarking standards to more diverse and efficient standards in the future.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The estimation of forest attributes using active remote sensing data and sampling designs is a solid scientific discipline oriented to derive structural information from forest ecosystems. In this study, we examined the problem of selecting predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) when using stepwise and multiple linear regression, and when using kNN imputation using Random Forests (RF) to select predictor variables. Systems of forest attributes and ecological indicators were estimated using ALS statistics and ground data collected in Central-East Spain, on two Mediterranean pine forest areas. Co-registration errors were simulated by means of altering ground data coordinates. The larger the co-registration error, the higher the variation in the selected ALS-based predictors in the parametric approach, which was less affected than the RF-based selection. In both cases, the final performance of the models was not as affected by co-registration errors as the observed variation in the selection of variables: the impact was around 1\% in the parametric approach while the value reached the 8\% for both stand basal area and the Gini-index under the non-parametric method. The forest biophysical attributes of the set behaved differently towards altering the co-registration factor in both cases. To control the co-registration factor between remote sensing data sources and ground surveys is an essential step to reduce uncertainty in data interpretation and in the modeling of forest attributes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

In this work, we highlight the importance of jointly considering both stability and predictive performance when the selection results are used for knowledge discovery and domain understanding. As a case study, we consider five popular feature selection algorithms, representatives of different selection approaches, and experimentally investigate their behaviour across three different domains: Internet advertisements, text categorization and biomedical data classification. Useful insight on the "intrinsic" stability of each algorithm seems to emerge, despite the peculiar characteristics of each dataset.},

Geographic information datasets are an example where the data points have stronger dependencies among each other the closer they are geographically. This phenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC) causes the standard cross validation (CV) methods to produce optimistically biased prediction performance estimates for spatial models, which can result in increased costs and accidents in practical applications. To overcome this problem, we propose a modified version of the CV method called spatial k-fold cross validation (SKCV), which provides a useful estimate for model prediction performance without optimistic bias due to SAC. We test SKCV with three real-world cases involving open natural data showing that the estimates produced by the ordinary CV are up to 40\% more optimistic than those of SKCV. Both regression and classification cases are considered in our experiments. In addition, we will show how the SKCV method can be applied as a criterion for selecting data sampling density for new research area.},

This paper describes an active learning-based approach to detecting individual standing dead trees, known as snags, from ALS point clouds and aerial color infrared imagery. We first segment individual trees within the 3D point cloud and subsequently find an approximate bounding polygon for each tree within the image. We utilize these polygons to extract features based on the pixel intensity values in the visible and infrared bands, which forms the basis for classifying the associated trees as either dead or living. We define a two-step scheme of selecting a small subset of training examples from a large initially unlabeled set of objects. In the first step, a greedy approximation of the kernelized feature matrix is conducted, yielding a smaller pool of the most representative objects. We then perform active learning on this moderate-sized pool, using expected error reduction as the basic method. We explore how the use of semi-supervised classifiers with minimum entropy regularizers can benefit the learning process. Based on validation with reference data manually labeled on images from the Bavarian Forest National Park, our method attains an overall accuracy of up to 89\% with less than 100 training examples, which corresponds to 10\% of the pre-selected data pool.},

In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques such as change detection are widely used for mapping and monitoring forest cover to detect the declining health and vigor of forests. These techniques rely on the assumption that the biophysical variation in the forest introduces a corresponding variation in its reflectance. The biophysical variations are assessed by foresters, but these assessment techniques are expensive and cannot be performed frequently to identify a specific level of change in the forest, for example, infection due to gypsy moths that results in forest defoliation. Further, the interaction of atmosphere, sensor characteristics, and phenology that are inherent in the remotely sensed images makes it difficult to separate biophysical changes from observational effects. We have addressed these limitations by developing a method to model the spectral reflectance properties of forests with varying degrees of defoliation using the Digital Image and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) tool. This paper discusses the in-canopy radiative approach and the impact of defoliation on the reflectance and radiance observed by sensors such as Landsat. The results indicate that the relative variation in forest reflectance between a non-defoliated and a 30\% defoliated deciduous forest can be as high as 10\% in the NIR spectral band. A function can be fit to predict the level of defoliation from the relative variation in radiance. The modeling and analysis techniques can be extended to assess the impact of atmospheric factors and sensor characteristics relative to the biophysical changes as well as for assessing other biophysical variables in forests.},

The objective of the present study was to use Artificial Neural Networks, based on the competition index and climatic and categorical variables, to predict tree survival and mortality in Semideciduous Seasonal Forests in the Atlantic Forest biome. Numerical and categorical trees variables, in permanent plots, were used. The Agricultural Reference Index for Drought (ARID) and the distance-dependent competition index were the variables used. The overall efficiency of classification by ANNs was higher than 92\% and 93\% in the training and test, respectively. The accuracy for classification and number of surviving trees was above 99\% in the test and in training for all ANNs. The classification accuracy of the number of dead trees was low. The mortality accuracy rate (10.96\% for training and 13.76\% for the test) was higher with the ANN 4, which considers the climatic variable and the competition index. The individual tree-level model integrates dendrometric and meteorological variables, representing a new step for modeling tree survival in the Atlantic Forest biome.},

It can also be described as a data-driven approach to agriculture, which is strongly connected with a number of data mining problems. One of those is also an inherently important task in agriculture: yield prediction. Given a yield prediction model, which of the predictor variables are the important ones?In the past, a number of approaches have been proposed towards this problem. For yield prediction, a broad variety of regression models for non-spatial data can be adapted for spatial data using a novel spatial cross-validation technique. Since this procedure is at the core of variable importance assessment, it will be briefly introduced here. Given this spatial yield prediction model, a novel approach towards assessing a variable's importance will be presented. It essentially consists of picking each of the predictor variables, one at a time, permutating its values in the test set and observing the deviation of the model's RMSE. This article uses two real-world data sets from precision agriculture and evaluates the above procedure.},

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

On the basis that the same principle can be applied to feature selection, we describe two approaches: (i) homogeneous, i.e., using the same feature selection method with different training data and distributing the dataset over several nodes; and (ii) heterogeneous, i.e., using different feature selection methods with the same training data. Both approaches are based on combining rankings of features that contain all the ordered features. The results of the base selectors are combined using different combination methods, also called aggregators, and a practical subset is selected according to several different threshold values (traditional values based on fixed percentages, and more novel automatic methods based on data complexity measures). In testing using a Support Vector Machine as a classifier, ensemble results for seven datasets demonstrate performance that is at least comparable and often better than the performance of individual feature selection methods.},

Estimation of error in land-cover change detection currently relies heavily on external, post hoc validation\textemdash{}i.e., comparison of estimated cover to independent values that are assumed to be true. However, reference data are themselves uncertain, and acquiring observations coincident with historical data is often impossible. Complementarily, modeling the transmission, or propagation, of error through the processes of classification and change detection provides an internal means to estimate classification and change-detection error at the scale of pixels. Modeling uncertainty around the estimate of fractional, ``continuous-field'' cover as a standard Normal distribution in each pixel at each of two times, we derive a method for propagating this uncertainty to categorical land cover-classification and change detection. We demonstrate the approach for mapping forest-cover change and its uncertainty based on bi-temporal estimates of percent-tree cover and their associated root-mean-square errors (RMSE). The method described here propagates only the imprecision component of error and not bias, so neither the resulting categorical estimates of cover nor the detection of change (e.g., forest loss) are affected by the transmission of uncertainty. However, propagating the RMSE of input estimates into probabilities of forest cover and change enables mapping and visualization of the spatial distribution of the imprecision resulting from model-based estimation of tree cover and from selection of the threshold of tree cover to define ``forest''. When compared to reference data with a fixed definition of forest (e.g., {$\geq$}30\% tree cover) the threshold effect is an importance source of apparent error in forest-cover and -change estimates. The approach described here provides a useful description of classification and change-detection certainty and can accommodate any definition of forest based on tree cover\textemdash{}an especially important consideration given the variety of institutional definitions of forest cover based on remotely sensible structural characteristics.},

  abstract = {Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that dieback levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81\% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70\% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for {$>$}40\% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of dieback, 81.5\% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3\% as declining and 6.2\% as dying or dead.

  abstract = {Leaf pigment content can provide valuable insight into the physiological performance of leaves. Measurement of spectral reflectance provides a fast, nondestructive method for pigment estimation. A large number of spectral indices have been developed for estimation of leaf pigment content. However, in most cases these indices have been tested for only one or at most a few related species and thus it is not clear whether they can be applied across species with varying leaf structural characteristics. Our objective in this study was to develop spectral indices for prediction of leaf pigment content that are relatively insensitive to species and leaf structure variation and thus could be applied in larger scale remote-sensing studies without extensive calibration. We also quantified the degree of spectral interference between pigments when multiple pigments occur within the same leaf tissue. We found that previously published spectral indices provided relatively poor correlations with leaf chlorophyll content when applied across a wide range of species and plant functional types. Leaf surface reflectance appeared to be the most important factor in this variation. By developing a new spectral index that reduces the effect of differences in leaf surface reflectance, we were able to significantly improve the correlations with chlorophyll content. We also found that an index based on the first derivative of reflectance in the red edge region was insensitive to leaf structural variation. The presence of other pigments did not significantly affect estimation of chlorophyll from spectral reflectance. Previously published carotenoid and anthocyanin indices performed poorly across the whole data set. However, we found that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI, originally developed for estimation of xanthophyll cycle pigment changes) was related to carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios in green leaves. This result has important implications for the interpretation of PRI measured at both large and small scales. Our results demonstrate that spectral indices can be applied across species with widely varying leaf structure without the necessity for extensive calibration for each species. This opens up new possibilities for assessment of vegetation health in heterogeneous natural environments.},

  abstract = {Forest plays a vital role in regulating climate through carbon sequestration in its biomass. Biomass reflects the health and environmental conditions of a forest ecosystem. In context to the climate change mitigation mechanisms like REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), an extensive forest monitoring campaign is especially important. Remote sensing of forest structure and biomass with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bears significant potential for mapping and understanding forest ecological processes. Limitations of the conventional forest inventory procedures, like the extensive cost, labor and time, can be overcome through integrated geospatial techniques. Optical sensor or SAR data are suitable for extracting information about simple and homogeneous forest stand sites. However, optical sensors face serious limitations, specifically in tropical regions, like the cloud cover that SAR can overcome along with targeting saturation and penetration aspects. Simultaneous use of spectral information and image texture parameters improves the biomass assessment over undulating terrain and in radical conditions. Also, synergic use of multi-sensor optical and SAR has better potential than single sensor. Interferometric (InSAR) and polarimetric (PolSAR) SAR or a combination of the both (PolInSAR) serves as effective alternatives. These techniques could serve as valuable methods for biomass assessment of heterogeneous complex biophysical environments. However, SAR data have its own limitations and complexities. Identifying, understanding and solving major uncertainties in different stages of the biomass estimation procedure are critical. In this regard, the current study provides a review of radar remote sensing-based studies in forest biomass estimation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Identification of wireline log shapes is of great significance for the research of paleogeography and paleosedimentology. Generally, this work is manually finished by geologists through careful observation of the morphological features of log curves. This process is subjective, tedious and may introduce artefacts depending on the bias of the interpreters. Therefore, we developed a model which exceeds the average performance of experienced geologists in identifying basic log shapes. The key to the excellent performance of the model is a large annotated dataset and a specially designed recurrent neural network. The dataset contains 2676 SP log segments of four basic log shapes (bell, funnel, egg and cylinder shape). The model has 8 layers, and the core is a layer of LSTM blocks which is designed to grasp the morphological features of the log curve. A committee of four experienced geologists annotated a gold standard test dataset, on which we compared the performances of the model and three other independent geologists. It turned out that the model exceeded the average performance of the three geologists in most circumstances, so the model is believed a powerful "AI" to free geologists from such heavy physical labour of log shape identification and maintain a higher accuracy. The research for this problem is still at the initial stage and expecting more work and ideas to further improve the robustness of the model. So, we also put forward some ideas for improving the current network and enlarging our dataset.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Biological invasion is considered the subsequent most important threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction and is documented as a main cause of global biodiversity loss and species extinction. Species distribution models can be used to identify areas that are at risk for invasions by harmful invasive alien species (IAS) if IAS have not yet spread to all suitable habitats. We tested the potential of combining two or more independent but complementary modelling methods to enhance the accuracy of spatial predictions. We used the modelling tools Maxent, GARP and BIOCLIM with presence-only data of the IAS Yushania maling (Maling bamboo), from Darjeeling, Himalaya to develop distribution maps. Modelling tools were chosen based on their performance with presence-only data (Area under curve (AUC)\,{$>$}\,0.7) as well as their differences in underlying modelling concept and statistics. The models combine occurrence records with topographic, climatic, and vegetative predictors derived from satellite data. By combining the 3 selected models in an ensemble approach we were able to minimize the spatial uncertainty related to suitable habitat prediction for Yushania maling. While both GARP and BIOCLIM consistently performed at an AUC\,{$>$}\,0.7, both our ensemble model and Maxent performed better with an AUC of 0.95 and 0.94 respectively. Moderately and highly suitable habitats for Yushania maling predicted by models correlated well with survey records except for GARP, where we found the model to over-predict suitability outside of the species' known ecological niche. Our findings identify the best modelling approach enhancing overall explanatory power of habitat suitability models. Our findings show that an ensemble approach should be used to ensure appropriate mitigation measures are applied in the appropriate places, enhancing overall effectiveness both ecologically as well as economically. It was shown that Yushania maling is indeed a threat to the ecosystems in the region, and while the species' potential habitat may decrease in some areas with climate change, other areas will become more suitable for it.},

We developed an approach to map canopy defoliation due to gypsy moth based on site differences in Landsat vegetation index values between non-defoliation and defoliation dates. Using field data from two study areas in the U.S. central Appalachians and five different years (2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, and 2008), we fit a sigmoidal model predicting defoliation as a function of the difference in the vegetation index. We found that the normalized difference infrared index (NDII, [Band 4-Band 5]/[Band 4+Band 5]) and the moisture stress index (Band 5/Band 4) worked better than visible-near infrared indices such as NDVI for mapping defoliation. We report a global 2-term fixed-effects model using all years that was at least as good as a mixed-effects model that varied the model coefficients by year. The final model was: proportion of foliage retained=1/(1+exp(3.057-31.483{${_\ast}$}[NDIIbaseyear-NDIIdisturbanceyear]). Cross-validation by dropping each year of data and subsequently refitting the remaining data generated an RMS error estimate of 14.9\% defoliation, a mean absolute error of 10.8\% and a cross-validation R2 of 0.805. The results show that a robust, general model of percent defoliation can be developed to make continuous rather than categorical maps of defoliation across years and study sites based on field data collected using different sampling methods.},

To investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of surface moisture and vegetation structure, data from ESA\&rsquo;s Copernicus Sentinel-1/-2 and NASA\&rsquo;s Landsat-8 for the period between March 2015 and November 2017 were utilized. In combination, these radar and optical satellite systems provide promising data with high spatial and temporal resolution. Sentinel-1 C-band data was exploited to derive surface moisture based on a hyper-temporal co-polarized (vertical-vertical\&mdash;VV) radar backscatter change detection approach, describing dynamics between dry and wet seasons. Vegetation information from a TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanner)-derived canopy height model (CHM), as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, were utilized to analyze vegetation structure types and dynamics with respect to the surface moisture index (SurfMI). Our results indicate that our combined radar\&ndash;optical approach allows for a separation and retrieval of surface moisture conditions suitable for drought monitoring. Moreover, we conclude that it is crucial for the development of a drought monitoring system for savanna ecosystems to integrate land cover and vegetation information for analyzing surface moisture dynamics derived from Earth observation time series.},

  abstract = {Many sugar maple stands in the northeastern United States experienced extensive insect damage during the 1988 growing season. Chlorophyll data and high spectral resolution spectrometer laboratory reflectance data were acquired for multiple collections of single detached sugar maple leaves variously affected by the insect over the 1988 growing season. Reflectance data indicated consistent and diagnostic differences in the red edge portion (680-750 nm) of the spectrum among the various samples and populations of leaves. These included differences in the red edge inflection point (REIP), a ratio of reflectance at 740-720 nm (RE3/RE2), and a ratio of first derivative values at 715-705 nm (D715/D705), All three red edge parameters were highly correlated with variation in total chlorophyll content. Other spectral measures, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Simple Vegetation Index Ratio (VI), also varied among populations and over the growing season, but did not correlate well with total chlorophyll content. Leaf stacking studies on light and dark backgrounds indicated REIP, RE3/RE2 and D715/D705 to be much less influenced by differences in green leaf biomass and background condition than either NDVI or VI.},

  abstract = {Expansion of agriculture over ecosystem areas is widely recognized as one of the most significant human alterations to the global environment over the last century. Although food and fiber production are essential ecosystem services (ES) to humankind, the clearing of forests for agricultural use is associated with changes in land cover which affect a wide range of ES at local, regional and global scales. Considering the importance of climate change, freshwater scarcity, soil erosion and other environmental issues, this paper aims to simulate the impact of land-use change on the ecosystem services related to water and carbon biogeochemical processes. The system under study is the Taquarizinho river basin, located in the eastern region of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, inserted in the upland borders of one of the largest wetland systems of the world, the Pantanal. Formerly occupied by Brazilian savannah (Cerrado), more than half of Taquarizinho watershed was converted both to agriculture and pasture lands since the 1960s. In order to quantify the impact of land-use change on ES provided by Taquarizinho over the years, this paper introduces the hydro-carbon model, which dynamically represents ecosystem services related to water and carbon cycles, such as canal discharge, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, biomass carbon sequestration, litter carbon sequestration, and soil carbon sequestration. The hydro-carbon model uses emergy for estimating the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by the river basin under different land-use scenarios. In this paper, extreme scenarios represent typical land-use types in Taquarizinho basin: native savanna (NS), agroforestry systems (AF), conventional tillage agriculture (CT), no-tillage multiple cropping agriculture (NT), degraded pastures (DP), and pastures under improved management (IP). Results in this paper reveal a hierarchy related to water and carbon ES provision, in descending order: native savanna (247EM\$ha-1y-1), agroforestry system (204EM\$ha-1y-1), pastures under improved management (180EM\$ha-1y-1), no-tillage multiple cropping agriculture (160EM\$ha-1y-1), degraded pastures (104EM\$ha-1y-1) and conventional tillage agriculture (75EM\$ha-1y-1).},

The tradeoff between model fit and model complexity provides a basis for describing the model-selection problem within the MOO framework. We discuss MOO and two strategies for solving the MOO problem; modeling preferences pre-optimization and post-optimization. Most conventional model selection methods can be formulated as solutions of MOO problems via specification of pre-optimization preferences. We reconcile model selection within the MOO framework. We also consider model selection using post-optimization specification of preferences. That is, by first identifying Pareto optimal solutions, and then selecting among them. We demonstrate concepts with an ecological application of model selection using avian species richness data in the continental United States.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content, a good indicator of photosynthesis activity, mutations, stress and nutritional state, is of special significance to precision agriculture. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of retrieval of chlorophyll content from hyperspectral vegetation indices composed by the reflectance of specific bands. In this paper, a set of vegetation indices belonged to three classes (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified simple ratio (MSR) index and the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI, TCARI) and the integrated forms (MCARI/OSAVI and TCARI/OSAVI)) were tested using the PROSPECT and SAIL models to explore their potentials in chlorophyll content estimation. Different bands combinations were also used to derive the modified vegetation indices. In the sensitivity study, four new formed indices (MSR[705,750], MCARI[705,750], TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750]) were proved to have better linearity with chlorophyll content and resistant to leaf area index (LAI) variations by taking into account the effect of quick saturation at 670nm with relatively low chlorophyll content. Validation study was also conducted at canopy scale using the ground truth data in the growth duration of winter wheat (chlorophyll content and reflectance data). The results showed that the integrated indices TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750] are most appropriate for chlorophyll estimation with high correlation coefficients R2 of 0.8808 and 0.9406, respectively, because more disturbances such as shadow, soil reflectance and nonphotosynthetic materials are taken into account. The high correlation between the vegetation indices obtained in the developmental stages of wheat and Hyperion data (R2 of 0.6798 and 0.7618 for TCARI/OSAVI[705,750] and MCARI/OSAVI[705,750], respectively) indicated that these two integrated index can be used in practice to estimate the chlorophylls of different types of corns.},

In large-scale applications, the number of samples one can collect is typically of the same order of (or even less than) the dimensionality of the problem. This so-called high-dimensional statistical regime has been the object of intense recent research in machine learning and statistics, primarily due to phenomena inherent to this regime, such as the fact that the noise one sees here often dwarfs the magnitude of the signal itself. While relevant in numerous important operations research and engineering optimization applications, this setup falls far outside the traditional scope of robust and stochastic optimization. We propose three algorithms to address this setting, combining ideas from statistics, machine learning, and robust optimization. Our algorithms are motivated by three natural optimization objectives: minimizing the number of grossly violated constraints; maximizing the number of exactly satisfied constraints; and, finally, developing algorithms whose running time scales with the intrinsic dimension of a problem, as opposed to its observed dimension\textemdash{}a mismatch that, as we discuss in detail, can be dire in settings where constraints are meant to describe preferences of behaviors. The key ingredients of our algorithms are dimensionality reduction techniques from machine learning, robust optimization, and concentration of measure tools from statistics.},

  abstract = {This work advances the evaluation and interpretation of the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress, over a range of canopy structures and pigment content levels. Very high resolution (VHR) narrow-band multispectral (10cm) and thermal (20cm) imagery was acquired diurnally, in four airborne campaigns conducted over an experimental vineyard site undergoing three different irrigation treatments. Field measurements of leaf stomatal conductance (Gs) and leaf water potential ({$\Psi$}leaf) were acquired concurrently with the airborne campaigns and compared against the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), a widely accepted, thermal-based indicator of water stress, and against narrow-band multispectral indices calculated from pure-vegetation pixels. The study proposes a new formulation, a normalized PRI (PRInorm), in which the standard PRI index is normalized by an index that is sensitive to canopy structure (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and by a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content (R700/R670). The hypothesis investigated is that the new index, calculated as PRInorm=PRI/[RDVI{$\cdot$}R700/R670], not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf area reduction induced by stress. Results demonstrated that when comparing PRInorm against stomatal conductance (r2=0.79; p{$<$}0.001) and leaf water potential (r2=0.77; p{$<$}0.001) measured at midday, the new index performed better than the standard PRI (r2=0.52 and 0.49, respectively). Further, when using the four flights conducted during the diurnal experiment, the relationships with stomatal conductance also showed the superior performance of PRInorm (r2=0.68) as opposed to PRI (r2=0.4). The proposed normalized PRI was highly related (r2=0.75; p{$<$}0.001) to the thermal indicator of water stress, CWSI, which was used here as a benchmark. In comparison, the standard PRI index was found to be significantly related to CWSI (p{$<$}0.001), although the relationship was weaker (r2=0.58) than that obtained for PRInorm. In summary, this study demonstrates that PRInorm isolated better than PRI the physiological changes against a changing background of altered pigments and structure, tracking more precisely the diurnal dynamics of the stomatal aperture. Simulations conducted, using leaf and canopy radiative transfer models to elucidate these results, showed that PRInorm is more linearly related to canopy pigment content than the standard PRI, and was more capable of differentiating between stress levels, providing better insight into the results of this diurnal study.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments carried out in a controlled environment facility to induce steady-state chlorophyll a fluorescence variation demonstrate that natural fluorescence emission is observable on the derivative reflectance spectra as a double-peak feature in the 690\textendash{}710 nm spectral region. This work describes that the unexplained double-peak feature previously seen on canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation. Measurements were made in a controlled environmental chamber where temperature and humidity were varied through the time course of the experiments in both short- and long-term trials using Acer negundo ssp. californium canopies. Continuous canopy reflectance measurements were made with a spectrometer on healthy and stressed vegetation, along with leaf-level steady-state fluorescence measurements with the PAM-2000 Fluorometer during both temperature\textendash{}stress induction and recovery stages. In 9-h trials, temperatures were ramped from 10 to 35 \textdegree{}C and relative humidity adjusted from 92\% to 42\% during stress induction, returning gradually to initial conditions during the recovery stage. Canopy reflectance difference calculations and derivative analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrate that a double-peak feature created between 688, 697 and 710 nm on the derivative reflectance is a function of natural steady-state fluorescence emission, which gradually diminished with induction of maximum stress. Derivative reflectance indices based on this double-peak feature are demonstrated to track natural steady-state fluorescence emission as quantified by two indices, the double-peak index (DPi) and the area of the double peak (Adp). Results obtained employing these double-peak indices from canopy derivative reflectance suggest a potential for natural steady-state fluorescence detection with hyperspectral data. Short- and long-term stress effects on the observed double-peak derivative indices due to pigment degradation and canopy structure changes were studied, showing that both indices are capable of tracking steady-state fluorescence changes from canopy remote sensing reflectance.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial and temporal changes caused by episodic disturbances and seasonal variability is essential for understanding the dynamics of mangrove forests at the landscape scale, and for building a baseline that allows detection of the effects of future environmental change. In combination with LiDAR data, we calculated four vegetation indices from 150 Landsat TM images from 1985 to 2011 in order to detect seasonal changes and distinguish them from disturbances due to hurricanes and chilling events in a mangrove-dominated coastal landscape. We found that normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) performed best in identifying both seasonal and event-driven episodic changes. Mangrove responses to chilling and hurricane events exhibited distinct spatial patterns. Severe damage from intense chilling events was concentrated in the interior dwarf and transition mangrove forests with tree heights less than 4 m, while severe damage from intense hurricanes was limited to the mangrove forest near the coast, where tree heights were more than 4 m. It took 4\textendash{}7 months for damage from intense chilling events and hurricanes to reach their full extent, and took 2\textendash{}6 yr for the mangrove forest to recover from these disturbances. There was no significant trend in the vegetation changes represented by NDMI over the 27-yr period, but seasonal signals from both dwarf and fringe mangrove forests were discernible. Only severe damage from hurricanes and intense chilling events could be detected in Landsat images, while damage from weak chilling events could not be separated from the background seasonal change.},

  abstract = {Variable selection is a difficult problem that is particularly challenging in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data. Here, we introduce the CAR score, a novel and highly effective criterion for variable ranking in linear regression based on Mahalanobis-decorrelation of the explanatory variables. The CAR score provides a canonical ordering that encourages grouping of correlated predictors and down-weights antagonistic variables. It decomposes the proportion of variance explained and it is an intermediate between marginal correlation and the standardized regression coefficient. As a population quantity, any preferred inference scheme can be applied for its estimation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that variable selection by CAR scores is very effective and yields prediction errors and true and false positive rates that compare favorably with modern regression techniques such as elastic net and boosting. We illustrate our approach by analyzing data concerned with diabetes progression and with the effect of aging on gene expression in the human brain. The R package ``care'' implementing CAR score regression is available from CRAN.},
