# Notes

- I like the introduction, very well-written and leading to three specific research questions
- predictive performance not very convincing (RMSE: 28), hence, predictions are most certainly unreliable.
However, this is what ecologists would be interested most.
Considering the efforts (marking 1000s of trees, hyperspectral imagery campaign, advanced ml approaches), the results are rather mediocre
